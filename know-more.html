        <h1>Know More About BMI</h1>
        <p><strong>Body Mass Index (BMI) </strong> is a simple calculation used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height. It is calculated by taking a person's weight in kilograms and dividing it by their height in meters squared.</p>
        
        <h3>Significance of BMI</h3>
        <p>BMI is a useful tool for assessing body weight in relation to height, which helps in identifying whether an individual is underweight, at a healthy weight, overweight, or obese. It is a quick screening method, but it is not a definitive measure of body fat or health. Understanding your BMI can guide you toward healthier lifestyle choices.</p>
